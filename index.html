        <p>
          Hi,
          I'm Subrata Chakraborty, I'm an engineering graduate specialized in Computer Application. At present, working as a Lead Cloud and Voice Infrastructure Engineer
          for an Australian Teleco named Southern Phone Company from 2017 and I carry multiple certifications across several information technology deciplines.
          with over 10 years of experience, managing several aspects of IT Infrastructure. My primary responsibilities are to lead the infrastructure team 
          with installation to configuring, administering, monitoring and troubleshooting various production and development resource issues 
          helping to ensure maximum uptime and availability of services. Figuring out the root cause of failure with vendor assistance, preparing and executing the 
          change plans including application update or security advisories issued by the vendors. 
          if you've already gone through my resume you'll notice that I've started my career as a Linux Support Engineer from 2009 and gradually inclined with public and
          private cloud like Nutanix and AWS. 
            After I've joined Southern Phone, I was fortunate that I got help and support from an amazing team
            we've started buliding the infrastructure from the scratch like DNS, Active Directory, PandoraFMS, OpManager, Nagios, 
            OrangeHRM, FreeRadius, Apache, Zimbra, Maria DB, ACS, LAMP, VoIPmonitor, Speedtest which helped the organization to manage customer services efficiently, 
            gain visibilty over operations and increased customer satisfaction.
            This resulting company to grow userbase further and finalize acquisition deal worth of 27.5 million with the biggest energy company in Australia named AGL.
            <br>
            <b>Thank you.</b>
